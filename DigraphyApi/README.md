### Checking path variables
- Right-click on the start button and go to system.
- Click advanced system settings.
- Click environment variables.
- go down to system variables and scroll down to Path.
- Click edit.
- If you do not see `.dotnet/tools` in there then you must add it.

### Updating path variabls
- Click new and add the file path to `.dotnet/tools` (the file is most likely found at `C:\Users\[Username]\.dotnet\tools`).
-  Close each of the tabs you opened by pressing OK.

### Setup database connection

In `/DigraphyApi`:

```shell
dotnet user-secrets set "ConnectionStrings:DigraphyDatabase" "Host=...;Database=neondb;Username=...;Password=...;SSL Mode=Require;Trust Server Certificate=true"
```

### Migrate the entities to the database
- Close the IDE and reopen it.
- Run `dotnet ef migrations add InititalMigration`.
- Run `dotnet ef database update`.

### Run the application
- Run `dotnet run`, (this should automatically launch a tab in your browser).
